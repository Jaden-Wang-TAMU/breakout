    <h1>Breakout!</h1>
    <h2>Proceed through the five levels by breaking all 64 bricks of each level!</h2>
    <h3> The 1st level is standard, the 2nd level has smaller bricks, the 3rd level has a smaller paddle, the 4th level has a smaller ball, and the 5th level turns your paddle invisible!</h3>
    <h3>You start with 10 lives, and each brick is worth different points! Yellow=1, Green=3, Orange=5, Red=7. There are also 2 random explosive and teleporter bricks per level!</h3>
    <h3>Here are your power-up blocks: The teal block lets you teleport the ball, the maroon block lets you move the paddle more, and the blue block creates another ball!</h3>
    <h3>You will receive alerts whenever you hit special bricks or power-up blocks. Right click to turn off alerts, and right click again to turn them on again!</h3>
